# AuthenticRealities

Authentic Realities was built in A-Frame in AR.js.

The model shows how a difference in someoneâ€™s salary for the same work at the same company has profound ramifications to our savings and investing potential. What is different about what we are doing that we are not only showing this with numbers on a spreadsheet, we are showing it as an experience in augmented reality.

A person stands in front of the screen currently with a Hiro or Kanji marker. Our 3D model runs a 30 year aging process. During this one can see how savings and investments accumulate quite differently from salary differences. Our app allows you to switch financial outcomes with someone equally qualified and unequally paid to understand their authentic reality.
